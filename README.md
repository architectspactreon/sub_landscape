# Substrate Landscape  

Map through the uncharted terrain of Substrate & Polkadot technologies.

Took motivation & referred to [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io) Cloud Native Landscape Project
.

## How to Run on your computer:
**If you have node.js installed locally**, just run `./server.js` from the root directory of the project and open http://localhost:8001 once the site is updated.

It requires any node.js version 14+ to be installed, does not use any npm package. It is both a server and a site builder - after any change the new site is built.
